# CPU Scheduling Visualisation

## Introduction

In operating systems, CPU scheduling is a fundamental concept that determines how tasks are allocated and executed on a computer's central processing unit.

This project aims to create a visualization tool that will allow users to interactively explore and compare these different scheduling algorithms.The significance of this project lies in the impact it will have on improving users' understanding of CPU scheduling algorithms and their effects on system performance. By visually simulating and comparing different CPU scheduling algorithms, users will have a more intuitive grasp of how these algorithms work and be able to make informed decisions regarding which algorithm to implement in their own systems.

## Project Objectives

1. Implementation CPU scheduling algorithms such as First-Come, First-Served (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), Priority, Preemptive Priority, Preemptive SJF / Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF), Round Robin (RR), and Multilevel Feedback Queue (MLFQ) Scheduling.
2. Visual Representation: Created an intuitive graphical representations of the CPU, processes, and scheduling events to provide users with a clear understanding of algorithm execution.
3. Performance Metrics: Calculate and display performance metrics such as turnaround time, waiting time, response time, and CPU utilization.
4. User Interaction: Enable users to interact with the simulation by adjusting parameters, starting/resetting the simulation, and analyzing results.
5. Comparison and Analysis: Provide tools for users to compare the performance of different scheduling algorithms and analyze the results.

## Project Scope

The project will focus on implementing and visualizing CPU scheduling algorithms in a desktop application. It will involve creating an intuitive user interface, implementing the algorithms in code, and integrating them with graphical elements to provide visual feedback to users. The tool will primarily target educational use cases but will also be suitable for professional training and analysis purposes.

The projectâ€™s scope will not include low-level operating system implementation or real-time scheduling algorithms used in embedded systems. It will also not cover advanced topics such as dynamic priority adjustment or real-time constraints.

## Conclusion

The CPU Scheduling Visualization Tool will provide an engaging and educational platform for exploring CPU scheduling algorithms. By meeting the objectives outlined above, our project aims to enhance understanding and facilitate learning in the field of operating systems. With clear objectives, well-defined scope, and appropriate technical requirements, we are confident that our project will result in a valuable and impactful educational tool.
